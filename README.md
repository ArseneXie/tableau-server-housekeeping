# Housekeeping scripts for Tableau Server
* Windows and Linux versions
* Customise these scripts for your environment by editing the variables at the top of each script. 
* Automate running them in cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows), or whatever enterprise job manager you use
* Update them when you upgrade! The tabadmin/tsm executables are run from a path that contains the version number, so whenever you upgrade to a new Tableau Server version, you need to update the script. Make this a documented part of your upgrade process
